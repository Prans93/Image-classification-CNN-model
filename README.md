Image classification using Convolutional Neural network

1. CIFAR-10 dataset (10-category classification of objects)
2. Breast histopathology dataset for determining whether a patient has cancer or not. The model defined in CancerIDC can be used for any image classification (Binary) by changing the CNN model accordingly e.g. like cats, and dogs classification.
